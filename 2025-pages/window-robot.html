    <h3>
        Problem
    </h3>
    <p>
        The <b>windows</b> at the Geisel Library are <b>dirty</b> and annoy library visitors. Manca notified the staff, but was ignored. <br>
        Windows get dirty quickly due to the buildup of dirt, pollution, and grease, which easily sticks to the surface. Cleaning them can be challenging, 
        as it often requires reaching difficult angles and heights, along with continuous wiping motions that may lead to injuries for homeowners with limited mobility. <br>
        A study performed by the <a href="https://www.ijimt.org/vol10/850-CM1008.pdf">International Journal of Innovation and Technology Management</a> was conducted to show 
        how homeowners and tenants respond at the time of cleaning the windows of their apartments or homes, how often they clean them, and what services they use more frequently. 
        The survey results showed a diverse and insightful response: <br>
        When asked about the level of satisfaction with the service to the windows. Around 56% of the respondents were not satisfied with the service.
